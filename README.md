# Health-Disease-Analysis(Crating using POWER BI)
Project Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an interactive and user-friendly Health Disease Dashboard using Power BI to visualize, monitor, and analyze key health and disease-related metrics. The dashboard aims to provide stakeholders—including healthcare professionals, public health authorities, and policy makers—with actionable insights by:

Tracking the prevalence and trends of various diseases across regions, age groups, and demographics.

Identifying patterns and correlations in disease outbreaks to support early intervention and resource allocation.

Monitoring healthcare performance indicators, such as hospitalization rates, recovery rates, and mortality.

Improving data-driven decision-making by offering real-time analytics and customizable views.

Enhancing public awareness and transparency through clear and accessible health data visualizations.

The dashboard will integrate data from multiple sources, ensure data accuracy and privacy, and support timely responses to emerging health concerns.
